# Civilization II 64-bit Editbox Patcher

Welcome!

This is Civilization II 64-bit Editbox Patcher.

It eliminates game and editor crashes on 64-bit systems when the game tries to display edit controls (input fields) for entering text (like city name, emperor name, world sizes etc.).

Unlike the [existing well known patch by Mastermind](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/193215/
) it will retain the full functionality of edit controls including the response to the Enter, TAB or Escape keys.

So, the establishing city is now just 'B', 'Enter'. And customizing world size is like '100', 'TAB', '100', 'Enter'. No more mouse clicking.

Supported game versions are:
* Civilization II Multiplayer Gold Edition
* Civilization II: Test of Time

The patcher can even detect if Mastermind's patch has already been applied and will replace it.
